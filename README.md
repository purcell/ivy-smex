# Use Ivy completion with Smex command matching

Smex has really nice handling of command histories, favouring commands
which have been executed most frequently in the past.  This package
provides an Ivy interface to those internals via the `ivy-smex`
command, which is meant as a replacement for
`execute-extended-command` or `smex`:

## Installation

### Manual

Ensure `ivy-smex.el` is in a directory on your load-path, and
add the following to your `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

``` lisp
(require 'ivy-smex)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-x") 'ivy-smex)
```

### MELPA

If you're an Emacs 24 user or you have a recent version of
`package.el` you can install `ivy-smex` from the
[MELPA](http://melpa.org) repository. The version of
`ivy-smex` there will always be up-to-date.
